I am a doctoral student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). In my work, I seek to answer the question of why citizens support authoritarian actors. Using various research designs and causal inference methods, I focus on former communist Europe and study how authoritarian actors shape attitudes towards autocracy & democracy, political conflicts and identities. This research seeks to shed light on the puzzling issue of authoritarian support. I am on the 2025/2026 Academic Job Market.
