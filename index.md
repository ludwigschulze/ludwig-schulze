I am a doctoral student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). This Spring Term, I am visiting New York University (NYU). In my work, I seek to answer the question of how authoritarian actors create popular support. Using various research designs and causal inference methods, I focus on former communist Europe and study how authoritarian actors shape attitudes towards authoritarianism, political conflicts and identities. This research aims to improve our understanding of how authoritarian regimes function and how they can leave behind a pro-authoritarian bias.
