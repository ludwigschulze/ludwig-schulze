I am a doctoral student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). This Spring Term, I am visiting New York University (NYU). My work focuses on the political legacy of communism and how it shaped attitudes towards authoritarianism, political conflicts and identities. I am deploying various research designs and causal inference methods.
