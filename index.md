I am a doctoral student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). In my work, I seek to answer the question of why citizens support authoritarian actors. Using various research designs and causal inference methods, I focus on former communist Europe and study how authoritarian actors shape attitudes towards authoritarianism, political conflicts and identities. This research aims to improve our understanding of how authoritarian regimes function and how they can leave behind a pro-authoritarian bias.
