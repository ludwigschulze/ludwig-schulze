I am a doctoral student at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). This Fall Term, I am visiting the London School of Economics (LSE). My work focuses on the political legacy of communism and how it shaped attitudes towards authoritarianism, political conflicts and identities. I am deploying various research designs and causal inference methods.
